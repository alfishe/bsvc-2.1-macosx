Introduction
============
This is a port of the Motorola 68000 assembler and simulation framework to Mac OS X (Mavericks). The distribution was originally put together by Bradford W. Mott. 

The port is ongoing and, for the foreseeable future, only the M68000 will work.

What follows is the original Announce.doc. I ported it to markdown since we are in 2014 after all..

BSVC is a microprocessor simulation framework written in C++ and Tcl/Tk.
It was developed as a senior design project at North Carolina State
University by Bradford W. Mott.  Since its original development many
professors and students have found BSVC to be a useful tool in courses
based on the Motorola 68000.  It has also been used as a starting point
for other senior design projects.

BSVC was originally written for Unix, however, it has been ported to 
Windows.  The Windows version has the same features as the Unix version 
except the Motorola 68000 simulator does not support the M68681 Dual UART.

The BSVC distribution contains the following:

  * Motorola 68000 simulator & assembler (Supports the M68681 Dual UART)

  * Motorola 68360 simulator (CPU32 like simulator)

  * BSVC Graphical User Interface (written in Tcl/Tk)

  * BSVC Simulator Framework (C++ classes)

Changes
=======

The following changes have been made:

2.0 to 2.1:
 
1. Some minor changes were made to the user interface to support
   Tcl/Tk 8.0

2. Some minor changes were made to the C++ code to support compiling
   with GCC 2.8.1

3. Jorand Didier's Motorola 68360 (sim68360) simulator has been added 
   to the distribution.  It doesn't contain all of the 68360 devices 
   but it does provide a CPU32 based simulator.

4. Xavier Plasencia's timer device has been added to the 68000
   simulator (modeled after the 68230 PI/T timer)

5. Fixed a bug with the MOVEA instruction in the Motorola simulators

6. Added support for the ABCD and MOVEP instructions to the
   Motorola simulators

7. Fixed bug in 68000 assembler when using $FFFF as an immediate 
   operand

8. Modified user interface so that it works with Windows 95, Windows 98,
   and Windows NT

 2.0 Beta 1 to 2.0:

1. Modified the BSVC C++ framework to use "standard" C++ libraries
   (STL).  Most of this work was done by Seunghee Lee so the 
   framework could be ported to Windows 95.  

2. Some minor changes were made to the user interface to support
   running it under Tcl/Tk for Windows 95.  This work was done
   by Seunghee Lee.

3. Modified Sim68000 to work with the new version of the C++ framework

4. Removed the Hector 1600 and MIL-STD-1750A simulators until they
   can be ported to the new framework

5. Fixed a problem with the predecrement and postincrement addressing
   modes when the stack pointer and a byte size operation was specified
       
Supported Systems
=================

The BSVC distribution is known to compile on the following systems:

  * Linux 2.x
  * Solaris
  * Windows 95, 98, and NT
  * Hopefully, Mac OS X 10.9+

Required Software
=================

BSVC requires the following software to compile and run:

  * ANSI C++ compiler with the STL library (gcc 2.7.2)

  * Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1
