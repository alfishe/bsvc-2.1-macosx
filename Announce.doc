Introduction
============

This is a port of the BSVC Motorola 68000 assembler and simulation
framework to Mac OS X (Mavericks). The distribution was originally
released by Bradford W. Mott in the nineties, while listening to Rick
Astley I presume.

Build the project
=================

By using the shipped makefile:

``` bash
make all
```

Example usage
=============

To assemble an example (produces `examples/example.h68`):

``` bash
./bin/asm68k examples/example.s
```

To execute the first 10 instructions from \$2000:

``` bash
./bin/sim68k examples/example.h68 --start 2000 -n 10
```

Running tests locally
=====================

    ./test/test.sh
